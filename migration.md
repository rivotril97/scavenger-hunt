The following is details on the timeline of migrating resources to Terp Network:

* **Start of CGAS Migration: Sept 20, 2022**

This can be found on the bottom page of keplr's settings, simply copy & paste these urls to ensure keplr is connected to chronic network properly.

#### LCD: https://chtd-api.skynetvalidators.com/
#### RPC: https://chtd-rpc.skynetvalidators.com/

## Step 3: Obtain your Terp Network wallet address


This will be located in the beta support tab of keplr wallet once succesfully connected to an application on the test-net [Link](https://www.skynetexplorers.com/wallet/import).

Note that you will need to specify `Terp Chain` when selecting the various networks for keplr to connect to. All private keys & sentitive information is not shared with the app. 

## Step 4: Obtain the IBC channel id

A link to the test-net ibc channel specs can be found [here](https://github.com/terpnetwork/test-net/blob/master/athena-1/relayers/README.md).

**The channel used from Chronic Chain to Terp-NET is channel-2.**


## Step 5: Using keplr, provide details of destination chain, destination address, channel-id, token denom & amount. 

This is done throught the chronic tab within keplr, find the ibc transfer and paste the information collected in the previous steps.


## Step 6: Sign and send the transaction

Confirm the transaction , and thats it! you should now see the cgas over in the terp wallet generated by keplr.
